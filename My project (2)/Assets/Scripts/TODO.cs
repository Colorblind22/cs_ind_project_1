    /* to do
        there is a bug where unpausing next to an enemy makes them go brrrrt.
            -fixed, last line of Enemy.FixedUpdate(), commented out jic i realize it was essential
        
        overclicking on NextWave button
            -fixed, Director.goingToNextWave

        add enemy scaling? (10% every 5 waves? add subtitle to WaveText for it?)
            -make a data class EnemyStats or something
            -In Director.Spawn set unit.stats to new EnemyStats(...); or something
        add 20mtd-esque upgrades. once every 3 waves?
