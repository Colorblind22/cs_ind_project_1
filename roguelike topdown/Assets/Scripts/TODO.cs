        add 20mtd-esque upgrades. once every 3 waves?


        bug with enemy move speed
        apparently theres a bug with pressing esc while in upgrade menu.

            -make sure when loading on a wave %5==0 it doesnt increase the difficulty factor after loading when it already did before saving
